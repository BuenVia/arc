                            <p>Your Vehicle Damage Assessor is the hub around which the repair process revolves and the recent pandemic
                            has added so many elements of doubt to the landscape of business.</p>
                            <p>So how do you cope if you have had to furlough your staff, or when they go on holiday,
                            or if they are taken ill, or worse, if they hand in their notice unexpectedly?</p>
                            <p>All of these situations have the ability to very quickly, leave a successful smooth flowing business,
                            facing some serious issues and as we all know, quality staff donâ€™t grow on trees.</p>
                            <p>We are able to offer Remote VDA Services as well as On Site Absence Cover, and in many instances, at very short notice.</p>
